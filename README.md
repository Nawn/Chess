# Chess
Building Chess for the Odin Project

In order to use/play my version of chess, you'll need to have<br>
-Ruby installed<br>
-'gem install terminal-table'

Those are the only things that my code depends on.

##Change directory to the directory you save these files in.
type 'ruby play.rb' and you'll begin to play Chess!
